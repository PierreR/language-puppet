v0.1.4
  New features
    * Basic native template function.
    * Added anchor as a native type for now. A better fix will be to just parse
      for defined types in the lib directory of modules.
    * Tentative defined() implementation. Will not work for resource references.
  Bugs fixed
    * String comparison is not case insensitive.
    * Variable scope for inherited classes should now work.
    * Support for the $module_name variable (probably a bit buggy).
  Various
    * Removed the title parameter from the catalog printing functions.
    * Used hslint a bit.
