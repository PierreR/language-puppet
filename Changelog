v0.2.1 ()
  Bugs fixed
	* The defaults system was pretty much broken, it should be better now.:
  New features
	* Basic testing framework started.
	* create_resources now supports the defaults system.
	* defined() function works for resource references.
	* in operator implemented for hashes.
	* Multithreading works.

v0.2.0 (2012/10/08)
  New features

v0.1.8.0 (2012/09/20)

	* Support of exported resource resolution through PuppetDB ! This results
	in an API breakage.
