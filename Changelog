v0.1.7.3 ()
  New features
	* Refactoring of the PuppetDB API for interfacing with the facter library.
  Bugs fixed
	* Exception handling for the HTTP failures.
	* Handles undefined variables in Ruby templates.
	* Undefined variables in Erbs now always throw exceptions. This is
	stricter than Puppet (which throws exceptions for "native" variables), but
	is I believe good practice.

v0.1.7.2 (2012/09/17)
  New features
	* Preliminary support for PuppetDB

	  found.
  New features
	* Amending attributes with a collector.

v0.1.6 (2012/08/01)
  New features
	* Errors now print a stack trace (only works with profiling builds).
	* Nested classes.
	* generate() function.
	* defines with spurious top level statements now should work.
	* validate_* functions from puppetlabs/stdlib.
  Bugs fixed

v0.1.5 (2012/07/06)
  Bugs fixed
	* Detection of spurious parameters when declaring parametrized classes now
	works.
	* Resource overrides with non trivial names should now work.
	* Require statements in required files would not be loaded.

v0.1.4 (2012/07/02)
  New features
	* Basic native template function.
	* Added anchor as a native type for now. A better fix will be to just parse
	  for defined types in the lib directory of modules.
	* Tentative defined() implementation. Will not work for resource references.
	* Functions md5, sha1, lowcase, upcase, split.
  Bugs fixed
	* String comparison is not case insensitive.
	* Variable scope for inherited classes should now work.
	* Support for the $module_name variable (probably a bit buggy).
	* Proper location of a "define not found" error.
	* Parsing bug for single quoted strings and slashes.
	* Bug where a resource name is a variable that is actually an array.
	* Array indexing.
	* Top level variables are now supported in Erb.
  Various
	* Removed the title parameter from the catalog printing functions.
	* Used hslint a bit.
